<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I am Niall Carroll. I got into web development quite by accident - a little bit
  of curiosity caused me to take a few introductory courses for coding. Surprisingly, I found that I really enjoyed coding!
  I decided to keep going with it, and a few short months later, I have this little portfolio of simple web pages to display. 
  I hope you enjoy looking at my projects.</p>

  <p>Please feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact me</a> if you have any questions or comments about my work!</p>
