<h1>The Best Movies (according to Niall)</h1>
<h2>My top three movies of <em>off the top of my head</em></h2>
<hr />
<h3>My Left Foot</h3>
<p>An Irish comedy-drama film, directed by Jim Sheridan, based on the autobiography of Christy Brown. It stars Daniel Day Lewis in the title role and Brenda Fricker, who plays Christy Brown's mother.</p>
<h3>Song of Bernadette</h3>
<p>Beautiful film about the real-life events in Lourdes, France, where the young Bernadette Soubirous witnessed apparitions of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Jennifer Jones won an Oscar for Best Actress in 1944 for playing the role of Bernadette. </p>
<h3>The Sound of Music</h3>
<p>Okay...I know it's a bit cheesy, but this 1965 film is still a great family movie after all these years. Some wonderful shots of Salzburg and the surrounding countryside, as well as numerous well-known songs to which you will just <em>have</em> to sing along!</p>
